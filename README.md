## Introduction

Configurations I have and scripts I use regularly on my GNU/Linux machines. Lot
of ideas taken from other dotfiles seen on Github.

In general, tools (and configurations as well) are as minimal as possible, or at
least this is what I've been trying to do. Currently, some configurations are
too ArchLinux specific. The idea is to "abstract" them in the future, when it is
possible (so they could be easily reused in other systems like Ubuntu).

Also, there are a lot of helpers for the programming languages I use more
frequently (Ruby, Clojure and Pharo Smalltalk).

## Most relevant configurations

* Bash (prompt, aliases, environment variables)
* Unix aliases and bash functions
* Git
* X: Xresources, Xmodmap, xinitrc
* Vimrc, bundle using Vundle
* Openbox (autostart, menu)
* Minimal tools that work well with Openbox, such as tint2, volumeicon or feh
* GTK 2/3 theming
* Default apps
* Key bindings through xbindkeys
* Specific Arch-Linux helpers (to install/upgrade/query packages)
